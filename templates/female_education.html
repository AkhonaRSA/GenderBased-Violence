        <h2 class="section-title">What is Gender-Based Violence?</h2>
        <p class="section-content">
            Gender-based violence (GBV) refers to harmful acts directed at an individual based on their gender.
            It is rooted in gender inequality, the abuse of power, and harmful norms. GBV can include sexual,
            physical, mental, and economic harm inflicted in public or in private. Examples include domestic
            violence, sexual harassment, rape, human trafficking, and harmful practices such as female genital
            mutilation and child marriage.

        <h2 class="section-title">Impact of Gender-Based Violence</h2>
        <p class="section-content">
            The impact of GBV can be devastating and long-lasting. Victims may suffer from physical injuries,
            mental health issues such as depression and anxiety, and social stigma. GBV can also have severe
            economic consequences, including loss of income and financial dependence on the abuser.
            It is important to recognize that GBV affects not only the victim but also families, communities,
            and society as a whole.
